<h2 align="center">Description</h2>

* The Poets Bay is a website where users can share their poems and get feedback from other users. As a project for the Programaci√≥n I at the "Universidad de Mendoza", we were tasked with creating a website using Flask and MYSQL. The Poets Bay is the result of that project. My name is Alexis Lino and I am the creator of this website. I hope you enjoy it!
